### Question 1: Calculate a table that shows the mean and standard deviation of hormonal concentrations by treatment.

```{r}
# Create a tibble (dataframe) containing the data collected:
data <- tibble(
  untreated = c(117, 124, 40, 88),
  oestrogen = c(440, 264, 221, 136),
  progesterone = c(605, 626, 385, 475))


# Compute the mean and the standard deviation for each treatment
data |> summarise(across(everything(),
                  list(mean = ~ mean(.x), 
                       sd = ~ sd(.x))))

```
