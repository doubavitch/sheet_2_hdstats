### Question 1: Calculate a table that shows the mean and standard deviation of hormonal concentrations by treatment.

```{r}
# Create a tibble (dataframe) containing the data collected:
data <- tibble(
  untreated = c(117, 124, 40, 88),
  oestrogen = c(440, 264, 221, 136),
  progesterone = c(605, 626, 385, 475))

# Compute the mean and the standard deviation for each treatment, and gather the results in a single table
summary_data <- data |> 
  summarise(across(everything(), list(mean = mean, sd = sd))) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Treatment", values_to = "Value") |> 
  separate(Treatment, into = c("Treatment", "Stat"), sep = "_") |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Stat, values_from = Value)

summary_data

```


### Question 2: Use ANOVA to test for a difference between treatments in the hormonal concentrations of the dogs, with a significance level Î± = 0.05. What is your conclusion about the effect of the treatments ?

```{r}
# First need reshape the data to long format in order to perform ANOVA
long_data <- data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Treatment", values_to = "Value")
long_data

# Use ANOVA on the data 
anova <- aov(Value ~ Treatment, data = long_data)

# Summary of the results obtained with ANOVA
summary_anova <- summary(anova)

cat("\nANOVA Summary")
summary_anova

# Extract p-value from the ANOVA summary
p_value <- summary_anova[[1]]$"Pr(>F)"[1]

cat("\n\nHypothesis testing:\n")
cat("p-value:", p_value, "\n\n")

# Test the hypothesis by comparing the p-value with the significance level alpha = 0.05
alpha <- 0.05
if (p_value < alpha) {
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis.\nWe conclude that there is a significant difference between treatments in the hormonal concentrations of the dogs.\nIn other words, the treatments significantly affected the hormonal concentrations of the dogs.\n")
} else {
  cat("We accept the null hypothesis.\nWe conclude that there is no significant difference between treatments in the hormonal concentrations of the dogs.\n\nIn other words, the treatments did not significantly affect the hormonal concentrations of the dogs.\n")
}

```
