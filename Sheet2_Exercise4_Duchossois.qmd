### Question 1: Calculate a table that shows the mean and standard deviation of hormonal concentrations by treatment.

```{r}
# Create a tibble (dataframe) containing the data collected:
data <- tibble(
  untreated = c(117, 124, 40, 88),
  oestrogen = c(440, 264, 221, 136),
  progesterone = c(605, 626, 385, 475))

# Compute the mean and the standard deviation for each treatment, and gather the results in a single table
summary_data <- data |> 
  summarise(across(everything(), list(mean = mean, sd = sd))) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Treatment", values_to = "Value") |> 
  separate(Treatment, into = c("Treatment", "Stat"), sep = "_") |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Stat, values_from = Value)

summary_data

```


### Question 2: Use ANOVA to test for a difference between treatments in the hormonal concentrations of the dogs, with a significance level Î± = 0.05. What is your conclusion about the effect of the treatments ?

```{r}
